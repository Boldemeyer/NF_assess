If you need to build the watershed boundary shapefile, you can find a CRB watershed shapefile on the
NAS at main/data/habitat/watershed_boundaries/WBDHU12.shp.

Import this into QGIS and you can select the watershed you want by right clicking on the 
watershed boundary shapefile, opening the attribute table, "select/filter feature by using form" or (ctrl +f),
filtering by "Name", clicking "select feature" at the bottom of the window. Double check that the selected watershed features
are correct. If all the watershed features aren't selected, you can activate the "select area by click"
icon at the top of QGIS and hold shift while you select more watershed boundary features. Once you have all the features selected,
you can export them as a shapefile by right clicking on the watershed boundary layer -> Export -> Save feature as... ** Don't forget to click the
"Save only selected feature" box before you save!
